# Kinetics-based Inference of Dynamic variation in microbial Interactions (KIDI)
## Release Notes
 - KIDI enables inferring environment-driven  dynamic variations in interspecies interactions from growth kinetics
 - This repository provides matlab live scripts and experiemntal data used for generating the results in the manuscript by Song et al. (2022)
 - For successful implementation of the code, please use matlab 2021b or newer versions.
